The Smith set is {A, B, D}.
C is the Plurality winner and also the Minmax winner.
Schulze elects A.

This is a Smith, Minmax failure example because C is automatically
disqualified in the first election since C is not in the Smith set; but
adding some A-first ballots gets C into the Smith set, after which it wins.
